This week was very good. We started working on our group projects! It has been really interesting ! I'm looking forward to what the final outcome is going to look like. I was struggling with my part of the project but I looked at examples and was finally able to do part of my job! For me it was hard because I feel like I don't have much imagination and I also didn't want to come up with something that seemed stupid so looking at the examples really helped me!!

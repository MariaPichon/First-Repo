## Week 8 ##

This weeek has been going really well! I have been getting a lot of work done! 
Although I got lots of work done this week I didn't geet enough time to finish all of my projects because I worked this whole weekend from morning to night and got home really tired. Although I catched up on many things that weren't complete I'm now behind on newer projects because i have been having trouble comprehending them.
